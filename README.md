# CTEC 227 Final Project Specifications

This document provides students with the details for their final project in CTEC 227. There are weekly milestones that students will need to pay attention to. Late work will not be accepted for any of the milestones.

The Syllabus states that the Final Project is worth **30%** of a students final grade in this class.

## Details

You are to design a multi-page website application that is powered by PHP, MySQL, HTML/CSS, and Bootstrap. Students can also include JavaScript code.

Students can choose to work on their project by themselves or with another student in the class.

Students will demonstrate their projects to the class on Thursday, June 18, 2020, at 10:00 AM.

You will have approximately 6 weeks to complete your work. When choosing what you want to build, I ask that you take inventory of your skills and don't try and build something that is way out of reach.

Some of the ideas that the class came up with for projects include:

- A customer service request/complaint application
- A content management system
- An image gallery system
- A link sharing application
- E-commerce Site (shopping cart)
- Review site
- Mental health/bipolar disorder symptoms tracker
- Recipe sharing
- Survey application
- Pet rescue site
- Store inventory system
- Reservation system
- Vacation Rental system

## Project Requirements

Your application **must** include the following:

- MySQL database with at least 3 different tables
- The database must be in 3rd normal form
- Provide a way to register and login to use your application
- Use functions and include files to functionally decompose your code
- Must use database sessions
- Must use forms
- Must use Bootstrap or another responsive framework
- Support responsive web design via Bootstrap
- Must be professional looking and not amateurish (more on this in class)
- HTML/CSS must validate
